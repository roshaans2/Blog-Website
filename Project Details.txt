Backend - 
For Backend Hono with cloudfare-workers.

Why Hono?

Hono is a lightweight, TypeScript-first web framework optimized for edge runtimes like Cloudflare Workers. I chose it because it delivers high performance, minimal bundle size, and runs at the edge—meaning the backend is deployed closer to users worldwide for faster responses.cl

Database - We have a postgress database in prisma, instead of using direct db link, we use accelerater link. (Connection Pooling).

Normally, when your app talks to the database, it opens a new connection each time.

If many users hit your app at the same time, it may open too many connections → database crashes or slows down.

Connection pooling (via Prisma Accelerate link) means: instead of opening a new door every time, your app goes through a shared gate where connections are reused and managed automatically.

This makes things faster, stable, and production-ready, especially for cloud or serverless environments.

When you have multiple servers in serverless architecture, you don't connect to the database directly. So, each of these servers connects to a connection pool, which connects to the database.

Q1. Why do we keep DATABASE_URL in .env when we already have the Prisma Accelerate URL?

A: Because DATABASE_URL is used by Prisma CLI for migrations and schema operations (DDL), which Accelerate does not support. Accelerate is only for runtime queries (DML).

Q2. Why can’t we put the Accelerate URL in .env?

A: Prisma CLI doesn’t understand prisma://… URLs — it needs a direct DB connection (e.g., postgresql://…) to run migrations, introspection, and client generation.
